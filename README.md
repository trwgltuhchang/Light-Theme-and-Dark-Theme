# Hypothesis Testing & A/B Testing
This project uses a user behavior dataset to apply and compare two statistical techniques — A/B testing and hypothesis testing — to evaluate the performance of Light vs. Dark website themes. By analyzing key engagement metrics such as Click Through Rate, Conversion Rate, Bounce Rate, Scroll Depth, and Session Duration, the goal is to determine whether theme design significantly influences user interaction.
## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset simulates user interaction with a website featuring either a Light Theme or a Dark Theme, with the following key attributes:
- Click Through Rate: % of users who clicked on site elements.
- Conversion Rate: % of users who signed up.
- Bounce Rate: % of users who left after viewing one page.
- Scroll Depth: How far users scrolled down pages.
- Session Duration: Time spent on the website.
- User demographics: Age, Location.
- Behavioral data: Purchases, Added_to_Cart.
## 🧪 Testing Highlights
Testing Highlights
Both A/B testing and hypothesis testing were applied to compare the effectiveness of Light and Dark themes across key engagement metrics:
- Click Through Rate (CTR):
<br> - 🔹 Hypothesis test result: Statistically significant difference (p = 0.048).

🔸 Conclusion: Dark Theme users clicked more frequently on-site elements.

Conversion Rate:

🔹 A/B test result: Light Theme had a slightly higher conversion rate.

🔸 Statistical test: Not significant (p = 0.635).

⚠️ Conclusion: No reliable evidence one theme converts better.

Bounce Rate:

🔹 Slightly lower for Light Theme, but difference not significant.

🔸 Conclusion: Theme choice does not affect bounce behavior meaningfully.

Scroll Depth:

🔹 Light Theme users scrolled slightly deeper on average.

🔸 Statistical test: Not significant (p = 0.450).

⚠️ Conclusion: No theme-based impact on scroll engagement.

Session Duration:

🔹 Light Theme users spent marginally more time on-site.

🔸 A/B test result: No significant difference found.

⚠️ Conclusion: Session time is similar for both themes.
## 💡 Key Insights
- 🔍 Dark Theme slightly outperforms in Click Through Rate, with statistically significant results.
- ⚖️ No strong evidence that either theme leads to higher conversions, lower bounce, or deeper engagement.
- 📉 Most differences between themes are not statistically significant — performance is largely comparable.
## 📌 Conclusion
Both Light and Dark themes offer similar user engagement outcomes. If optimizing for click engagement, Dark Theme has a slight edge. However, there's insufficient evidence to declare one theme significantly better for conversions or user retention.
