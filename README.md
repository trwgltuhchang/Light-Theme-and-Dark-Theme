# Hypothesis Testing & A/B Testing
This project evaluates how Light and Dark website themes influence key user engagement metrics using A/B testing and hypothesis testing techniques. Metrics analyzed include Click Through Rate, Conversion Rate, Bounce Rate, Scroll Depth, and Session Duration.
## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset simulates user interaction with a website featuring either a Light Theme or a Dark Theme, with the following key attributes:
- Click Through Rate: % of users who clicked on site elements.
- Conversion Rate: % of users who signed up.
- Bounce Rate: % of users who left after viewing one page.
- Scroll Depth: How far users scrolled down pages.
- Session Duration: Time spent on the website.
- User demographics: Age, Location.
- Behavioral data: Purchases, Added_to_Cart.
## 🧪 A/B Testing Highlights
Using proportion z-tests and independent t-tests, we compared user behaviors between themes:
- Purchases: No statistically significant difference in conversion rates (p > 0.05).
- Session Duration: Light Theme showed slightly higher average time, but not significant.
- CTR vs. Conversion Rate Correlation: Positive trend observed across both themes.
Visualizations:
- Scatter, histograms and box plots revealed slight differences across themes, but nothing conclusive.
## 💡 Key Insights
- 🔍 Dark Theme slightly outperforms in Click Through Rate, with statistically significant results.
- ⚖️ No strong evidence that either theme leads to higher conversions, lower bounce, or deeper engagement.
- 📉 Most differences between themes are not statistically significant — performance is largely comparable.
## 📌 Conclusion
Both Light and Dark themes offer similar user engagement outcomes. If optimizing for click engagement, Dark Theme has a slight edge. However, there's insufficient evidence to declare one theme significantly better for conversions or user retention.
